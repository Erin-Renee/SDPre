<h3>What is your ultimate goal in attending Skill Distillery? How are you going
  to achieve it? What is your big 'why'?</h3>
I am coming into this program from a completely different career field. After
leaving the military, I found myself searching for a career that would be
challenging and satisfying. I went on to get my Bachelors degree. After my degree
I decided to exploremy options outside of the medical field. I quickly gained
employment including project management. I loved the fast-paced environment,
solving conflicts, and working with a team to meet a common goal. The company
I worked for was smaller, and I found myself unemployed between projects. I
decided I wanted to find a more stable career in a technical field. I started
looking into software development. I decided I wanted to program with Java
because it is one of the most widely used programming languages. I discovered a
program that was just made available in May that helps veterans get into the IT
field. I picked Skill Distillery because they teach Full Stack Java and also
have very good reviews and a comprehensive program. Denver also ranks third in
the nation for high-tech workers, so this is a very desirable area for me to
build connections in the field. Ultimately, I would like to gain employment
as a full stack Java developer in the Denver area. This program is an amazing
opportunity, and I feel blessed have this opportunity. This will help me move
into an in-demand career field; and change my life not only professionally but
personally. That is why I am going to do everything I can to succeed.

<h3>What experience do you have coding? What have you created already? What do
you want to create during/after the program?</h3>

I do not have any experience with coding prior to this class. I have really
enjoyedworking through the coding exercises provided on GitHub, and in the book
“Learn Java the Hard Way” by Graham Mitchell. I loved being able to use and
improve my problem-solving skills to create working code. My goal is to be able
to help a company improve by creating software applications that will help them
become more efficient. I am looking forward to creating my first application
using Java.

<h3>When you get frustrated and discouraged what do you do? How can you
keep your confidence up and encourage yourself during the program?</h3/>

When I get frustrated and discouraged, I think of all the things I have achieve
so far. I think of achievements like joining the military, moving across the
country, deploying, getting my degree, solo traveling overseas, changing career
fields, starting my own business, and getting into this program. These things
remind me that I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I also think of the hard
times I have been through like loss of loved ones, unemployment, and other
personal hardships. These hardships have helped me become a stronger more
resilient person. During times of stress, I know that I am capable of pushing
through it. I know there will be challenges and a lot of hard work and long
nights to come in this program. I recognize that these challenges will help me
become an even stronger person and more prepared when I become employed.

<h3>What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where
does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?</h3>

When you include ‘import java.util.Scanner’ in your code, it imports the
‘java.util.Scanner’ package into your program. This package contains utility
classes that gives your program the ability to receive external input from the
user. The Java in ‘java.util.Scanner’ tells the program that the util.Scanner
needs to be imported from the java folder.

<h3>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does
and in which cases you should use them.</h3>

In Java, we use = to assign a value of one variable to another. so you could
assign a=5 or a=b.
 == is an operator and equals () is method. "==" will check the memory reference
 point of the variable to see if they are in the same location. If they are,
 then they are equal and it is defined in the object class. Basically if the
 variable is stored in the same location then it is
true and will be defined. This operator doesnt compare actual characters or
numeric values to see if they are the same.  If you need to compare content of the variable,
then you use 'equals()'. The equals() method the main purpose is to
compare the contents of the object like its characters or numeric value. For
example if you made a string to have a user input a password "secret", then the
program will compare the characters of the characters to see if they are the same.
So if the user types anything but "secret", it will not be true.
